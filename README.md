# Shoutout to CRA

This project was create with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Running the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn && yarn start` or `npm install && npm run start`

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# Technologies Used

Obiously, React is used to power the front end. Additionally, this project uses react-boostrap, bootstrap, and typescript. Those are the only dependencies. The scoreboard is powered by LocalStorage, so none of your data ever leaves the browser!
